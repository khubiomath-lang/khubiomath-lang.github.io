Our research group focuses on the applications of computational modeling and applied mathematical methods to the study of physical and biological questions. We employ tools of applied mathematics such as ordinary/partial differential equations and numerical methods. We also develop numerical methods for such physical and biological problems at hand.

Specifically, our research focuses on these areas: mathematical modeling and numerical simulations of epidemiological systems with an emphasis on the use of optimal control theory, and computational stochastic modeling using agent-based models and network models in infectious disease transmission dynamics.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.-->
