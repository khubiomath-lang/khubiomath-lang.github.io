We employ tools of applied mathematics such as ordinary/partial differential equations and numerical methods. We also develop numerical methods for such physical and biological problems at hand.</p> <p>Specifically, our research focuses on these areas: mathematical modeling and numerical simulations of epidemiological systems with an emphasis on the use of optimal control theory, and computational stochastic modeling using agent-based models and network models in infectious disease transmission dynamics.</p> </body></html>
